                            E-learning can best be defined as the science of learning without using paper printed
                instructional material. E-learning is the use of telecommunication technology to deliver information for
                education and training. With the progress of information and communication technology development,
                E-learning is emerging as the paradigm of modern education. The great advantages of E-learning
                include liberating interactions between learners and instructors, from limitations of time and space
                through the asynchronous and synchronous learning network model (Pei-Chen Sun et al., 2008). Elearning is commonly referred to the intentional use of networked information and communications
                technology in teaching and learning. A number of other terms are also used to describe this mode of
                teaching and learning. They include online learning, virtual learning, distributed learning, network and
                web-based learning. The term E-learning comprises a lot more than online learning, as the letter “e” in
                E-learning stands for the word “electronic”, E-learning would incorporate all educational activities that
                are carried out by individuals or groups working online or offline
